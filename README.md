# vlnn-tutorial README

This is the simple learning exersize rather then an useful extension. It may become useful by itself though!

## Features

None documented at the moment!

## Technicalities

``extension.js`` has all entry points for commands.

``package.json`` has metadata and registration of the custom commands/keybindings.

``node_modules`` has modules needed to build the extension.

## Requirements

``npm`` in order to build it.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

**TBD**
